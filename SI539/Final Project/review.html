    <h3>Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Make sure there is enough contrast between text and its background color

        </li>
        <li>Don't indicate important information using color alone

        <li>
            Pair values of colors together (not only hues) to increase contrast

        </li>
        <li>
            Don't rely on sensory characteristics as the sole indicator for understanding and operating content

        </li>

        <p>The website does a good job overall, however, it can be improved in the following aspects:</p>
        
    <p>
        1. The alt text for pictures are not appropriate enough. The alt text should It people who use the screen reader understand what an image is about. However, the alt text for the images of leadersandbest.umich.edu are either missing or vague. For example, the images in the thumbnails of the photo gallery don't have alt texts. The images show in the banner gallery use the text on the banner as their alt texts. Though they are related, providing a clear description of what the image is about will help people understand what it means by "student support" or "bold ideas"

        </p>
        
    <p>2. The layout should be more consistent. It is said that "Components with the same functionality should work and be identified consistently." (Source  <a href=http://accessibility.voxmedia.com/#designers> Accessibility Guidelines </a>) However, although the thumbnails under the banner serve for the same function, the layout and the typeface of the text on them are not the same ("especially the 5th one"). The first thumbnail even doesn't have a descriptive text at all. It will be better if the first one can have a description for it and the fifth one can come with a image as the background.
    Furthermore, in terms of the typeface, there are multiple kinds of typefaces appear on the same page. It doesn't look neat and formatted enough. It will be better if just applying one or two typeface and distinguish different content by setting different color, font weight or size.

        </p>  
        <p></p>
        
    <p>
        3. Another tiny flaw of the website is the hover effect of the "Give Now" button is not obvious enough. The focus effect for the other part of the website is good enough, it would be better if it can distinguish the hovered "Give Now" button more clearly.
