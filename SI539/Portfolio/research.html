            <p>FOOBB optimization is a project for the course Contextual Inquiry and Consulting. Our team completed a contextual inquiry for Menlo Innovations, during which we conducted field observation, interviews, and data analysis to help Menlo optimize the implementation of their Open Book Management System.

                <p> 
                    Menlo adopted Open Book Management (OBM) by using the Front Office Open Book Board (FOOBB), a transparent set of the company's financial statements. Menlo hoped the transparency would help people improve their performance in workplace based on the overall interpretation of the board and company's operation condition.

                    However, the implementation of FOOBB in Menlo didn't go as well as expected. According to the employer's observation, changes in its team's behavior are hard to find.

                <div class = contentA>
                <p>
                We set up a meeting with the stakeholder of Menlo in order to get a better understanding of their expectation.
                    
                From the discussion we learned that, since most of their employees were engineers and developers, it might be difficult for them to fully understand the story that FOOBB told to them.

                At the same time, the employer was confused about what should be done in order to help people get more familiar with the board.
